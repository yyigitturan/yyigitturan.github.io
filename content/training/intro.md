MathQuantum training aims to provide undergrads, grad students, and postdocs the knowledge and skills needed to apply Mathematics toward QIS research problems. Our training program aims to provide depth and breadth in foundational Math and QIS knowledge plus hands-on skills. In addition, our training extends beyond traditional educational experiences through robust mentoring support, community building, professional development experiences, exposure to societal impacts of QIS, and proposal development training.

Two main groups are ideal candidates for our training program: (a) current Math students with no or little experience in quantum, who want to enter QIS and (b) current students with moderate or high experience in QIS who want to advance their QIS work with stronger Math skills. The goal is to enable crossover between Math and QIS, so our program aims to fill any skills and knowledge gaps. Training components are divided into: Mentoring, Education, Professional Experience, and Community-Building. Learn more about all components below.

### What's the MathQuantum RTG?
MathQuantum is a Research Training Group, a term used by the NSF in reference to efforts that meaningfully integrate undegrad, grad student, postdoc, and faculty experiences and needs into a cohesive research community. Our RTG specifically focuses on on enabling Mathematicians to enter the world of QIS (Quantum Information Science).

How do the MathQuantum fellowships fit into the picture?
MathQuantum fellowships are a core component of the RTG, as they are the mechanism through which undergrads, grad students, and postdocs participate. These are paid fellowships that are accompanied by a set of educational and training activities. Learn more about these [here](/training)

### I don't know anything about quantum. Can I be a fellow?
Yes. MathQuantum is primarily interested in bringing Mathematicians into the world of Quantum Information Science (QIS). As such, no previous experience in quantum is needed. These applicants should have some level of familiarity or interest in at least one of the following areas of (Applied) Mathematics: Algebra/Representation Theory, Nonlinear Analysis, PDEs, Scientific Computing and Stochastic Analysis, as well as Data Science and Machine Learning.

### My thesis/postdoc adviser doesn't work in quantum. Can I be a fellow?
Yes. As long as your adviser is open to you pursuing research work in QIS (Quantum Information Science), or is interested in expanding their research to QIS, you're eligible for the program. We would work with you and your adviser to find a suitable expert collaborator/mentor that will allow you to pursue this research within our RTG.

### I already work on quantum. Can I be a fellow?
Yes. MathQuantum is interested in strengthening Quantum Information Science (QIS) efforts through mathematical rigor. Students and researchers already working on QIS, but interested in expanding that research with Math skills, are welcome as fellows.

### What are the eligibility criteria?
Each level of fellowship has slightly different requirements (check out details [here](/fellowship/)), but the main requirement across all is U.S. citizenship or permanent residence. Non-U.S. persons may apply and be considered for a fellowship but cannot receive a stipend (although they still receive all other benefits, including the $1,000 for conferences/workshops). Fellows accepted to the program without a stipend have a lower level of requirements (see [here](/nonstipend/)).

### What are the benefits of being a fellow?
Each level of fellowship has slightly different benefits (check out details [here](/fellowship/)). Generally, each fellow will receive mentoring, a range of training experiences, a stipend and funds to attend conferences.

### What is expected of fellows?
Each level of fellowship has slightly different expectations (check out details [here](/fellowship/)). Generally, each fellow is expected to participate in a given set of training activities (mentorship, education, professional development, and community building).

### Do non-stipend fellows have different requirements than stipend fellows?
Yes. Individuals selected for the program without a stipend have a smaller set of requirements, described [here](/nonstipend/).

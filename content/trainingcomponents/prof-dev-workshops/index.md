Monthly professional development workshops (1-2 hours) on various topics are aimed at supplementing the skills of our Fellows with those that are not typically obtained in coursework or regular research duties. Topics are selected yearly based on input from Fellows about their
needs and interests. Example topics include: Github for collaborative research; LaTeX for academic writing; Principles of Visual Communication; CVs vs. Résumés Workshop; Ethics in QIS; Principles of Poster Presentations; Communicating Math through Drawing; Invited career talks by researchers from different career sectors. Facilitators for these workshops are a combination of the MathQuantum organizers, UMD professional experts in a given topic, our own MathQuantum Fellows, alumni Fellows, and representatives from our internship partners.
Due to the importance of mentor training, one of these monthly workshops each year covers the subject of Best Mentoring Practices, particularly approaching topics such as mental health and inclusion.

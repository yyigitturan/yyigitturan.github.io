Fellows participate in peer/near-peer mentoring teams of two or three Fellows matched using career, professional, and scientific interests and needs. Teams hold one meeting per semester using a peer mentoring meeting guide, and fill out an individual report. The goal of these meetings is for participants to practice mentoring, while simultaneously obtaining advice from same-or near-level colleagues who have complementary skills, knowledge and experience.

Twice a year, we hold group meetings to bring together faculty and Fellows from all three Quantum themes. These meetings primarily
involve research groups presenting updates on their project’s progress. Presentations are expected to be developed as a vertically integrated team prior to the event, with group members from all career stages contributing. Based on community input and needs, we use these meetings
for other purposes, such as special training sessions, discussions about important current topics, MathQuantumS-wide planning, receiving feedback for program assessment, etc.

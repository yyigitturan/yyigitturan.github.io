[Maryland Day](https://marylandday.umd.edu) is a yearly event hosted by UMD, where the university opens to the general public, drawing tens of thousands of visitors. Each year, we host a MathQuantum booth, rotating focus to one of our three Quantum themes. The members of each year’s theme work as a vertically integrated team to design creative games, activities, materials, and/or handouts appropriate for their theme. The goal is to inform, educate, and inspire Maryland Day attendees about the role of Mathematics in QIS, its applications, and its potential as a career.

MathQuantum aims to equip our Fellows to pursue intentional Broader Impacts activities in their careers. This workshop consists of Fellow teams exploring the societal impact of Math and QIS, and developing Broader Impacts projects during the week before Spring semester. Project examples will include: a MathQIS video tutorial for K-12 or undergraduate students; an informal educational activity like those by the Museum of Mathematics; an infographic on a MathQuantum concept; a general audience writing similar to those in Quanta magazine. Teams receive daily training, guidance, and feedback from MathQuantum organizers. The Fellows' team projects are disseminated through our RTG website
and YouTube channel, as well as the National Q-12 Education Partnership website, so that Fellows' outreach work goes out to the real world. This experience allows our Fellows to understand how Broader Impacts can fit into their research and future proposals. It ensures that they have a tangible Broader Impacts product that is disseminated and contributes to their CV. The activity also impacts Fellows’ communication
skills and gives perspective on how their field of study can impact society.

The MathQuantum Annual Symposium is a showcase of the research done by our Fellows and faculty. It is an opportunity for the entire
community across the three Quantum themes to present progress, network, and exchange ideas. The symposium format adapts to MathQuantum RTG community feedback and interests, but generally consists of (i) research lightning talks, (ii) a research poster session, (iii) a research keynote presentation, and (iv) an RTG community-building activity. Keynote presentations are by non-UMD speakers working on exciting research that bridges Mathematics with QIS (including internship partners). This event is open to the entire UMD community in order to promote connections between mathematicians and other quantum-interested scientists at our institution.

Research Interaction Teams (RITs) are an initiative established at the UMD Department of Mathematics in 2002. They consist of informal groups co-organized by faculty members and postdocs, designed to foster interaction between faculty, students, and postdocs, and to get students interested in current research. Most of them meet as informal seminars in both Fall and Spring with active student participation.
RITs are a good setting for Fellows to gain broad perspective of QIS concepts and research. Since RITs involve presentations of original research and journal articles by all participants, they further provide opportunities for communication practice. We expect RITs to cover all three Quantum research areas of the RTG. The RIT is a venue for our Fellows and faculty across the three Quantum themes to interact with each other and broaden their knowledge of QIS concepts and research. We also expect to invite alumni Fellows to present.

Organization of research events is a key aspect of scientific leadership. In this event, MathQuantum Graduate Fellows (with assistance from Undergraduate Fellows, Postdoc Fellows, RTG leadership) gain experience in this area by organizing an informal but research-centered MathQuantum event by students and for students. Graduate Fellows are free to pick a theme, focus, format, and content for the event (e.g., a career workshop inviting panelists from different sectors, a student-only research showcase, a MathQuantum hackathon). The goal of this component is to give graduate students opportunities to develop their leadership identities. Though the organizing Fellows decide on the audience and magnitude, they're encouraged to open it up to a broad range of students at UMD and other local schools, or the local community.

At the beginning of their tenure, each Fellow holds a one-on-one welcome meeting with the MathQuantum organizers to get orientation about the program vision and expectations. They also develop an individualized research/education plan (to ensure that each Fellow has a path to acquire necessary technical skills) and a professional/personal development plan. Each Fellow receives a yearly check-up meeting to report progress, identify emerging short- and long-term goals, and re-evaluate plans. Fellows are also encouraged to reach out for ad hoc meetings between check-ups. This component provides all participants with centralized and consistent mentoring support, and allows each participant to maximize the program’s offerings to address personal needs and interests (e.g., specific grant proposal writing and submission assistance for Postdoc Fellows; specific job application assistance for graduating Graduate Fellows). These meetings also provide Fellows an avenue to give direct feedback.

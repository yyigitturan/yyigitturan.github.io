title: RIT (Research Interaction Team) in Quantum Information Science, Fall 2023
---
### Organizers:
Dong An, Maria Cameron, Carl Miller, Konstantina Trivisa

### Overview:
In this seminar, we are interested in all aspects of research at the intersection between quantum information science and mathematics.  Goals for the seminar include:
- Studying recent research results in quantum information from a mathematical angle;
- Finding examples (old and new) in which existing tools from mathematics have been adapted for application in quantum information;
- Studying quantum algorithms for mathematical problems.
In the Fall 2023 semester, we will focus on tutorial talks that will introduce a basic theoretical toolbox for quantum computing.

If interested in joining, reach out to Daniel Serrano (dsvolpe@umd.edu).
Optional: 1 credit. Course number: AMSC689, Section 5201. See Jessica Sadler for help with registration (jsadler@umd.edu). To earn 1 credit, you need to give a talk.

"A Mathematical Perspective on Quantum Information Science" - Carl Miller
Mathematical innovation has been crucial in quantum information science since its inception, and the relationship between the two fields is vital and evolving.  While the theory of quantum information depends most directly on linear algebra and probability, other mathematical connections appear in quantum research that are diverse and often surprising.  This talk will offer a personal perspective on the interaction between quantum and math.  We will discuss an example from the field of quantum cryptography.

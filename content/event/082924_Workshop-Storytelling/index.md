In interviews or networking conversations, you are often asked these questions: “So, tell me about yourself” or “Tell me about a time when you…” Most of us feel a sense of dread toward these prompts but know how important they are to our careers. After all, people can only get to know us through the stories we are willing to share. 

This workshop will help you craft your stories depending on your audience and setting. In 90 minutes, you will practice coming up with stories and sharing them in a way that highlights your skills, accomplishments, and values. You will grow awareness of your strengths and increase your confidence in talking to others, even with strangers. Next time you are asked to share about yourself, you will rock storytelling like a pro.

This workshop is highly interactive. There is structured time for intentional reflection during the workshop. And you will practice sharing and receiving stories in a small group of 2 other attendees.

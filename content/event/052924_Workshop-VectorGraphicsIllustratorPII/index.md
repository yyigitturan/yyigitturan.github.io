Come practice creating and editing vector graphics, a useful skill for researchers to present concepts via figures, diagrams, and other visual products.

In this hands-on session, we will use Adobe Illustrator to reproduce example QIS journal article figures. These have been selected to implement techniques learned in [Part I](https://youtu.be/T4tq72ep800?si=u1MKtZvAYIGnm4y_) of the series, while learning a few new techniques.
Skills from Part I are expected, so review or catch up via [the recording](https://youtu.be/T4tq72ep800?si=u1MKtZvAYIGnm4y_).

The event is formally scheduled till 1pm, but we have the room till 1:30pm in case participants want to stay longer.

__Pre-workshop instructions:__
__1. Review or catch up__ on Part I via [this recording](https://youtu.be/T4tq72ep800?si=u1MKtZvAYIGnm4y_).

__2. Bring computer + Illustrator:__ This is a hands-on tutorial workshop. To fully benefit, please bring your own computer with Adobe Illustrator installed.
UMD members have access to Illustrator through Terpware:
Windows - [Faculty/Staff](https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1968) | [Students](https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1971) ||| Mac - [Faculty/Staff](https://terpware.umd.edu/Mac/Title/1968) | [Students](https://terpware.umd.edu/Mac/Title/1971)
Feel free to reach out to Daniel Serrano <dsvolpe@umd.edu> to get assistance preparing for the workshop.
The room will open at 11:50pm for pre-workshop troubleshooting.

__3. Optional:__ Send Daniel <dsvolpe@umd.edu> examples of figures/diagrams youâ€™d like to be able to create. With sufficient time, we will go over the tools and skills needed to create those specific ones.

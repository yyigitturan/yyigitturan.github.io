Join us for a movie, pizza and discussion, while meeting others at UMD interested in quantum computing! Anyone curious about quantum technology and its applications is welcome, regardless of expertise.

Taming the Quantum World (46min) is a 2013 documentary by Lars Becker-Larsen about the development of quantum computers. At this movie night, we will watch the film, and follow it by small- and large-group critical discussion. We will delve into topics such as
- What can audiences of different backgrounds get out of a film like this?
- How is quantum computing represented in popular media (paying attention to accuracy and hype)?
- How have our knowledge and perceptions about quantum computers changed in the 10 years since this film was made?

This event is co-organized by the MathQuantum and [UQA](https://www.umduqa.com).

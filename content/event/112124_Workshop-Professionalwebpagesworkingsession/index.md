This is a followup to our October workshop on building your professional webpage with github and Jekyll themes.

In this session, participants will have a chance to continue working on their webpage while getting feedback about format and content. Advanced tools might be covered upon request.

This is an informal working session and participants are welcome to come and go between the scheduled start and end times.

Those who didn't attend the previous workshop are more than welcome to attend. They may catch up by following the recorded tutorial at https://youtu.be/Pof342wGt78 or get started from scratch the day-of with help of Daniel S.

RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/jYUa1v1NPN5VPyQs5).

Join us for a movie and pizza, while meeting others at UMD interested in quantum computing! Anyone curious about quantum technology and its applications is welcome, regardless of expertise.

The Race: How to Build a Quantum Computer (1h 17min) is a 2019 documentary by David Kleijwegt about the development of quantum computers.
Since it's finals time, this will just be an opportunity to watch a movie and eat pizza with like-minded quantum enthusiasts. Informal optional discussion might happen afterwards.

This event is co-organized by the MathQuantum and [UQA](https://www.umduqa.com).

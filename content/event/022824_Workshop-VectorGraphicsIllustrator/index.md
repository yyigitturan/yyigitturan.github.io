Come learn the basics of creating and editing vector graphics, a useful skill for researchers to present concepts via figures, diagrams, and other visual products.

This tutorial will introduce vector graphics using Adobe Illustrator, a major vector graphics creation and editing tool. Emphasis will be placed on tools and concepts relevant to mathematicians and quantum scientists.

We will then explore attendees’ interests in visualization for their own work. This will help us identify pragmatic and advanced topics to be covered in future Parts of the tutorial series.

__Pre-workshop instructions:__
__1. Bring computer + Illustrator:__ This is a hands-on tutorial workshop. To fully benefit, please bring your own computer with Adobe Illustrator installed.
UMD members have access to Illustrator through Terpware:
Windows - [Faculty/Staff](https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1968) | [Students](https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1971) ||| Mac - [Faculty/Staff](https://terpware.umd.edu/Mac/Title/1968) | [Students](https://terpware.umd.edu/Mac/Title/1971)
Feel free to reach out to Daniel Serrano <dsvolpe@umd.edu> to get assistance preparing for the workshop.
The room will open at 2:45pm for pre-workshop troubleshooting.

__2. Optional:__ Send Daniel <dsvolpe@umd.edu> examples of figures/diagrams you’d like to be able to create. With sufficient time, this will help inform the tools and concepts covered in the tutorial.

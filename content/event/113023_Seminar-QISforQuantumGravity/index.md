RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/jYUa1v1NPN5VPyQs5). Coffee and snacks will be provided.

While Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity have been experimentally tested extensively, they stand as incompatible theories, challenging our fundamental understanding of the Universe. The quest to construct a consistent theory of Quantum Gravity stands at the frontier of research in theoretical physics. In the last few decades, concepts from Quantum Information Science, such as entanglement and complexity, have started playing a central role in this quest.

This seminar will provide an overview of the intersection between Quantum Information Science and Quantum Gravity at a popular science level. We will discuss black holes, entropy, information, the holographic principle, AdS/CFT correspondence, quantum entanglement, and quantum complexity, scraping the surface of deep connections between information and gravity.

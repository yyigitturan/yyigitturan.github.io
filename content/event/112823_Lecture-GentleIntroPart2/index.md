Join us for Part 2 of this lecture, which will continue introducing quantum computing from a mathematical point of view.

Part 1 covered historical perspectives of math and computing that led to the current status of quantum computing. It then introduced some basic concepts like qubit, measurement, superposition and entanglement. To recap, you can access a recording at https://youtu.be/FMfjwVIBaws

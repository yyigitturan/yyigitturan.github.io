The lecture will present elements from early history and make references to some of the giants in quantum computation, starting with Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin. It will then give a picture of the State of the Art today as far as available hardware is concerned after introducing some basic concepts: qubit, measurement, superposition and entanglement.

During his lifetime, Feynman (an American theoretical physicist) became one of the best known scientists in the world. Yuri Manin (a Russian mathematician) was known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry. Both of them independently advocated the idea of "computation grounded in physics", which led to the modern concept of quantum computation and the idea of storing and processing information. 

The involvement of Mathematicians has been crucial since the beginning of quantum information science. It was another mathematician Peter Shor who in 1994 discovered a polynomial-time algorithm for factoring numbers igniting a flurry of activity that created the field of quantum information.

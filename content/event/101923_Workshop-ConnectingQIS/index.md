RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/jYUa1v1NPN5VPyQs5). Coffee and snacks will be provided.

Come explore how you could fit in the world of Quantum Information Science (QIS) research. In this workshop, we will guide you to map the connections between your existing interests/skills and QIS.

The event will consist of a short intro lecture, guided exercises, feedback on your ideas, informal presentations by participants, and group discussion. __By the end of the workshop, you will have a draft QIS research question.__

This event is primarily intended for two audiences:
(i) Math grad students and postdocs who are curious to know more about QIS
(ii) grad students and postdocs (any field) already working in QIS, who want to integrate more advanced Math into their work

Undergrad students in the two categories above are also welcome if they have good familiarity with doing literature searches.

Students/postdocs outside of Math/QIS are also welcome, but please let Daniel (<dsvolpe@umd.edu>) know ahead of time your intent to participate and your discipline.

Additional logistics:
- Please bring a laptop to engage in all activities.
- The workshop will be 2h long.
- This workshop is limited capacity in order to allow for meaningful engagement. RSVP is required so we have a clear headcount.
- Participants familiar with doing literature searches (using Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchRabbit, etc.) will be able to make the most out of this workshop. Participants without this familiarity are welcome, but we appreciate if you let Daniel (<dsvolpe@umd.edu>) know ahead of time that you might need assistance with this.

This info session will go over the new UMD MathQuantum fellowships.

**What we’ll cover:**
- What’s the MathQuantum RTG (research training group)
- What’s the MathQuantum Fellowship and what are the benefits (preview below)
- Fellowships for Grad Students vs fellowships for Undergrads
- How to apply
- Questions from attendees

**Who should come:**
- **Grad students** curious about, or working on, quantum information science (QIS). Math, Computer Science, and Physics students are highly encouraged, but all disciplines are welcome
- **Undergrad students** interested in UMD grad studies in QIS, or interested in paid undergrad QIS research experience. Math majors are highly encouraged but all disciplines are welcome
- **Faculty** interested in having current or new undergrad/grad mentees work on QIS research

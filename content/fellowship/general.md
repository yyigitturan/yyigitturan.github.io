MathQuantum [high school](#highschool), [undergraduate](#undergraduate), [graduate](#graduate), and [postdoctoral](#postdoc) fellowships are a core element of our [Research Training Group](/vision/). Ideal candidates for our fellowships are: 
- current Math students with little or no experience in quantum information science (QIS), who want to enter this exciting research area, and 
- current students with moderate or high experience in QIS who want to advance their QIS work with stronger Math skills. 

Our program aims to fill any skills and knowledge gaps to enable crossover research between {{< hl >}}mathematics{{< /hl >}} and {{< hl >}}quantum information science{{< /hl >}}.


All fellows benefit from:
- [ ] Mentored [research](/research) and [interdisciplinary training](/training) in applying mathematical methods to QIS problems.
- [ ] Coursework and seminars in theoretical and applied mathematics for QIS.
- [ ] Internship opportunities at quantum companies and government labs.
- [ ] Professional development and networking opportunities (including on Broader Impacts and proposal writing).
- [ ] One-on-one career mentoring and guidance.
- [ ] Community-building and outreach activities.

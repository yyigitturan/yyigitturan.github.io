- [ ] Engage in a mentored research project applying math to QIS
- [ ] Attend 2 [professional development workshops](/trainingcomponents/prof-dev-workshops/)
- [ ] Complete the [Theory of QIS course](/trainingcomponents/fall-theory-course/)
- [ ] Complete the [Applications of QIS course](/trainingcomponents/spring-computing-course/)
- [ ] Participate once in the [Quantum Information Science RIT](/trainingcomponents/rit/)

- [ ] Teach 2 semesters
- [ ] Engage in mentoring junior fellows
- [ ] Attend MathQuantum RTG community and outreach events ([Annual Symposium](/trainingcomponents/annual-symposium/), RTG meetings, etc.)

These expectations may be fulfilled over multiple years. Activities completed before the fellowship period may retroactively count towards fulfillment of the expectations (e.g. having already taught or taken a course).

## Eligibility criteria:
- [ ] Current or incoming UMD College Park graduate student working in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Physics and interested in quantum
- [ ] U.S. citizen or permanent resident (non-U.S. persons may apply but cannot receive a stipend, although they still receive all other benefits, including the $1,000 conference/workshop funding; requirements for non-stipend fellows are lower and can be found [here](/nonstipend/)).
